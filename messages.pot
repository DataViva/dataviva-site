In DataViva one can also visualize the \"Industry Space\", a representation of the connections of all Brazilian economic activities based on their shared occupations."

The goal is to show graphically which are the main occupations employed in various economic activities, their importance to each industry and the number of employees who work in these activities. Prescriptive in nature, this visualization compares the location in question with a reference calculated from the definition of other similar localities in terms of economic structure. Consequently, it enables, in a single visualization, the ability to know what are the main occupations of an industry, how many professionals work in comparable localities, how many professionals work in the region, and how many of them work specifically in that region and industry."
msgstr ""

#: dataviva/html/about/apps/occugrid.html:5
msgid "This type of visualization allows an analysis of the labor market of a region, the professions needed to develop an industry, and, in conjunction with other applications about economic activities and occupations, links occupations and economic activities (which may also be related to the products they manufacture). It is also an initial step towards an analysis of human capital training needs in a locality, revealing shortcomings of qualified personnel and its importance for the economic activities analyzed."
msgstr ""

#: dataviva/html/about/apps/occugrid.html:7
msgid "Unlike the other applications, the Occugrid allows only one type of output, because it was created especially for the analysis of occupations (and related economic activities).

msgid "The Rings visualization allows viewing a product, industry or occupation in isolation, making it easier to navigate round its primary and secondary connections, which can be a bit difficult in the Network application. Also a prescriptive application, its main advantage is to create a visualization of the location of an isolated product, industry, or occupation in the network, revealing all of their first degree connections and the connections of these connections (second degree). It also shows those products, activities or occupations in which the selected location has revealed comparative advantage (RCA> 1)."
msgstr ""

#: dataviva/html/about/apps/rings.html:5
msgid "This is important because, according to the Product Space theory, having comparative advantage in a product means that the region has the expertise to produce it and the knowledge that is shared in the production of connected products. Thus, one can visualize, quickly and easily, if the product has many connections and if these are with products that the region already has comparative advantage, which would facilitate its development, because it means that much of the productive knowledge needed is already present."
msgstr ""

#: dataviva/html/about/apps/rings.html:7

This graph facilitates the analysis and definition of the more interesting activities and products for the economic development of a region by putting together two indicators of the Product Space theory."
msgstr ""

#: dataviva/html/about/apps/scatter.html:5
msgid "For example, to determine which product would be more interesting for the development of a location, one can use the Scatter app to analyze simultaneously the indicators of complexity and distance of a product from the current production structure of this location. Products with higher complexity and lower distance will be located in the same quadrant of the graph and those would be, in principle, the ones with the greatest potential for the location."
msgstr ""

#: dataviva/html/about/apps/scatter.html:7
msgid "One visualization, for example, shows the economic activities of Minas Gerais and its plot distribution considering the distance (x-axis) and the unique occupations (y-axis). Note that “Construction” is the group of activities with the highest number of unique occupations and one of the smallest distances to the state, while Financial Services & Insurance is the group with the smallest number of unique occupations and greater distance. Hence, the application allows easy analysis of the activities and products of a region from the intersection of two of the indicators calculated based on the Product Space theory."

Therefore, this application facilitates an understanding of the growth patterns and trends of any of the variables available in DataViva."

Ubiquity is the number of regions that export a given product with comparative advantage. The index is based on the idea that more complex products are produced and exported by a smaller number of regions, while requiring more productive knowledge to be manufactured. Therefore, more complex products are those produced by few regions that produce different products."

The idea here is that each product requires a set of capabilities, which may or may not be shared in the manufacture process of other products (%(prox)s). Products closest to other products in which the region already has comparative advantage will be more easily developed - because some of the required knowledge is already present in the region. Distance is a measure that reflects the amount of new capabilities that a region needs in order to manufacture and export a product with comparative advantage, meaning that the greater the distance, the more knowledge that needs to be acquired and the longer (or more difficult) it will be to have advantage in the export of this product."
