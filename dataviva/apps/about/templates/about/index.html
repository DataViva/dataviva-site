            <p>{% trans %}DataViva is an initiative of the Government of the State of Minas Gerais and Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) – The State of Minas Gerais foundation for research funding and support – that offers its users a dynamic access experience to a large range of public data. Totally developed in free software and with open access to all, DataViva was created to contribute to the implementation of public policies, private and public investments, and to help academic studies.{% endtrans %}</p>
            <p>{% trans %}Initially designed to assist the economic development policy of the Government of the State of Minas Gerais, the project came from the need to make the access to Brazilian economy data easier and intuitive. Developed in partnership with MIT Media Lab researchers (one of the main innovation centers in the world), the platform offers an unprecedented solution in the country, through the database provided by the Ministério do Trabalho e Previdência Social (MTPS), Ministério do Desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio Exterior (MDIC) and Ministério da Educação (MEC) – the Ministries of Employment; Development, Industry and International Trade; and Education, respectively.{% endtrans %}</p>
            <p>{% trans %}One of the conception pillars of DataViva is the BigData technology, a technique designed to generate knowledge and intelligence from the processing of a large volume of data. Based on international references, the project features, in its current version, national data from the last decade concerning economy, education, industry, labor market, and other categories, viewed by location. Providing open and free access to these information, DataViva offers a more detailed knowledge of the Brazilian economy, generating inputs for the planning and decision making by entrepreneurs, students, investors and professionals of any economic sector and from anywhere in the world.{% endtrans %}</p>
