<h1>RCA</h1>

<p>{% trans %}The Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) shows the share of exports in a region of a given product in relation to the participation of this product in the world trade. In other words, the RCA measures if the share of a product in the exports of a region is larger or smaller than this product participation in the international trade. If the participation is equal, the RCA will be 1, meaning that the region exports exactly the "fair share" for all regions (an average share of the total exports divided by the number of regions). When the RCA of a region is larger than 1, it means that this region exports, in percentage terms, more than the "fair share", meaning that it has a comparative advantage in the export of this product in relation to other regions.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}In DataViva, the calculation of the RCA is made considering the global trade (International), and just Brazilian exports (Domestic).
For industries, the RCA is calculated only for Brazil, following the same participation logic. An RCA greater than 1 in an industry means that the region has a larger share than the average in that industry, in terms of number of employees.{% endtrans %}</p>
