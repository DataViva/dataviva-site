<h1>{% trans %}Proximity{% endtrans %}</h1>

<p>{% trans %}The proximity between two products is the main index used for the creation of the Product Space, being a measure of the probability of product co-export. Using global export data, it estimates the probability of a product being exported by a country that also exports another specific product. This calculation is made for all products of the standard international trade classification (HS 4-digit level). The products most likely to be co-exported are considered connected in the network, based on the assumption that they share capabilities required for their manufacture.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}To build the "Industry Space" and the connections between occupations the same reasoning is used. The proximity of the industries is calculated based on the probability of co-occupancy between two activities, meaning that it is a measure of the probability of two industries having the same occupations, and therefore requiring common capabilities. Similarly, the proximity of occupations is calculated based on the likelihood of these being employed in the same industry, revealing a productive knowledge that is used in various sectors of the Brazilian economy.{% endtrans %}</p>
