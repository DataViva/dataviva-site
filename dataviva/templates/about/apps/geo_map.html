<h1>{% trans %}Geo Map{% endtrans %}</h1>

<p>{% trans %}The Geo Map is a descriptive geographical visualization that enables an analysis of the spatial distribution of the variables available in DataViva. Using a heat scale, it shows the municipalities with the largest (in red) and lowest (blue) values, and allows navigation both to zoom in and out, as to see more information about a selected municipality. This visualization aims to reveal the geographic distribution of the data.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}One of the visualizations, for example, shows the economic activities in Minas Gerais by municipality, showing its concentration in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, in the southern part of the state and in the so called Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro. As in other visualizations, you can change the visualization to the desired variable with the filters.{% endtrans %}</p>
