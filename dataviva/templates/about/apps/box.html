<p>{% trans %}The Box Plot visualization allows analyzing the change of a variable's range across a series of distinct points. Each box represents the IQR, or Interquartile Range for a series of data. This range is defined by the first and third quartiles, with a bisection line repesenting the median. Whiskers extend from the IQR to show the minimum and maximum values for the data series.{% endtrans %}</p>
