<h1>{% trans %}Network{% endtrans %}</h1>

<p>{% trans %}The Network visualization displays the original Product Space, using the same network of products created by professors Hidalgo and Hausmann based on worldwide exports. It represents the connections between products in terms of the probability of co-exportation of these, and is the basis of the theory of economic development proposed by these professors from MIT and Harvard, respectively. In DataViva one can also visualize the "Industry Space", a representation of the connections of all Brazilian economic activities based on their shared occupations.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}This visualization allows highlighting, in the Product Space or the Industry Space, all products or activities in which a region has Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA>1). Therefore, one can see where are the products or activities in which a region has comparative advantage, if these products or activities are in the central region of the network (are more complex) and what are their connections.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}This is a prescriptive visualization that reveals interesting ways for the economic development of a region based on the Product Space theory. According to this theory, a region must move (gain comparative advantage) to products or activities located in the center of the network, starting from those products or activities in which it already has comparative advantage.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}One visualization, for instance, on DataViva, is the Industry Space of Minas Gerais, allowing to quickly learn in what activities the state has comparative advantage and in which categories they are (from the same color pattern used on all visualizations).{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}For a better understanding and interpretation of this visualization, it is recommended to check the terms and basic concepts of the Product Space theory.{% endtrans %}</p>
