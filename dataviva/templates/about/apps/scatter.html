<h1>{% trans %}Scatter{% endtrans %}</h1>

<p>{% trans %}The Scatter visualization is another prescriptive visualization which allows comparing the distribution of economic activities and exports of a location based on the relationship between two variables (one on the X axis and another one on the Y axis). This graph facilitates the analysis and definition of the more interesting activities and products for the economic development of a region by putting together two indicators of the Product Space theory.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}For example, to determine which product would be more interesting for the development of a location, one can use the Scatter visualization to analyze simultaneously the indicators of complexity and distance of a product from the current production structure of this location. Products with higher complexity and lower distance will be located in the same quadrant of the graph and those would be, in principle, the ones with the greatest potential for the location.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}One visualization, for example, shows the economic activities of Minas Gerais and its plot distribution considering the distance (x-axis) and the unique occupations (y-axis). Note that “Construction” is the group of activities with the highest number of unique occupations and one of the smallest distances to the state, while Financial Services & Insurance is the group with the smallest number of unique occupations and greater distance. Hence, the visualization allows easy analysis of the activities and products of a region from the intersection of two of the indicators calculated based on the Product Space theory.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}As in other prescriptive visualizations, it is recommended to know the terms and concepts of the Product Space theory to make a correct interpretation of the visualization.{% endtrans %}</p>
