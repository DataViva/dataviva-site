<p>{% trans %}The Occugrid deals specifically with RAIS data regarding occupations in Brazil. The goal is to show graphically which are the main occupations employed in various economic activities, their importance to each industry and the number of employees who work in these activities. Prescriptive in nature, this visualization compares the location in question with a reference calculated from the definition of other similar localities in terms of economic structure. Consequently, it enables, in a single visualization, the ability to know what are the main occupations of an industry, how many professionals work in comparable localities, how many professionals work in the region, and how many of them work specifically in that region and industry.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}This type of visualization allows an analysis of the labor market of a region, the professions needed to develop an industry, and, in conjunction with other visualizations about economic activities and occupations, links occupations and economic activities (which may also be related to the products they manufacture). It is also an initial step towards an analysis of human capital training needs in a locality, revealing shortcomings of qualified personnel and its importance for the economic activities analyzed.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}Unlike the other visualizations, the Occugrid allows only one type of output, because it was created especially for the analysis of occupations (and related economic activities). However, the output can use different parameters and types of grouping. One of the possible visualizations shows the average number of jobs per establishment for the “Arts and Entertainment” industry in Minas Gerais.{% endtrans %}</p>
