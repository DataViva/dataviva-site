<h1>{% trans %}Rings{% endtrans %}</h1>

<p>{% trans %}The Rings visualization allows viewing a product, industry or occupation in isolation, making it easier to navigate round its primary and secondary connections, which can be a bit difficult in the Network visualization. Also a prescriptive visualization, its main advantage is to create a visualization of the location of an isolated product, industry, or occupation in the network, revealing all of their first degree connections and the connections of these connections (second degree). It also shows those products, activities or occupations in which the selected location has revealed comparative advantage (RCA> 1).{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}This is important because, according to the Product Space theory, having comparative advantage in a product means that the region has the expertise to produce it and the knowledge that is shared in the production of connected products. Thus, one can visualize, quickly and easily, if the product has many connections and if these are with products that the region already has comparative advantage, which would facilitate its development, because it means that much of the productive knowledge needed is already present.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}Similar to other visualizations, Rings uses a standard color pattern that lets one see of which big group a product, industry or occupation belongs, as well as other groups with which it is connected. Correctly understanding the concepts of the Product Space theory is fundamental to interpret this prescriptive visualization.{% endtrans %}</p>
